abstract: We present constraint-based and (hybrid) score-based algorithms for causal
  structure learning that estimate dynamic graphical models from multivariate time
  series data. In contrast to previous work, our methods allow for both “contemporaneous”
  causal relations and arbitrary unmeasured (“latent”) processes influencing observed
  variables. The performance of our algorithms is investigated with simulation experiments
  and we briefly illustrate the proposed approach on some real data from international
  political economy.
