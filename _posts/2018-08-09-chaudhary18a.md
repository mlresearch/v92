abstract: We consider the problem of learning causal relationships in continuous additive
  noise models (ANM) from a machine learning perspective. Causal discovery from ANMs
  has primarily focused on testing for independence between the residuals and the
  true parent set of a variable. We posit that this unique association between residuals
  and the true parent set can be leveraged with kernel mean embedding to predict causal
  relationships in observational data. In particular, we propose a framework that
  finds useful patterns and constructs the causal graph by predicting the true parent
  set of each variable. We present an analysis of the patterns from kernel mean embeddings
  that explains their discriminative ability in predicting causal relationships. Finally,
  we perform simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
