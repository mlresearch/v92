abstract: Causal inference is often taken to mean finding links between individual
  variables. However in many real-world cases, such as in biological systems, relationships
  are more complex, with groups of factors needed to produce an effect, or some factors
  only modifying other relationships rather than producing outcomes alone. For instance,
  weight may alter the efficacy of a drug without causing side effects itself. Such
  moderating factors may change the timing, intensity, or probability of a causal
  relationship. Distinguishing moderators from genuine causes can lead to more effective
  medical interventions, and better strategies for bringing about a desired effect,
  since a moderator alone is ineffective. However, there have not yet been algorithms
  to automatically infer moderators in a large-scale automated way, and they cannot
  be easily read off from causal graphs. We introduce a set of temporal logic rules
  to automatically identify the asymmetric roles of causes and moderators in a computationally
  efficient manner. Experiments on simulated data demonstrate that even in challenging
  cases we can find moderators and avoid confounding, and on real neurological ICU
  data we show how the approach can find more descriptive and meaningful relationships
  than the state of the art.
